                    <hr></hr><br></br>
                    <p>The Institute has created several specialised centres for multi-disciplinary research, development and entrepreneurship. This has been done as part of its focus on select areas of sustainable innovation-enablement and technology-based opportunity creation. These centres would take initiatives to enable early as well as long-term benefits to the campus, society and the nation. These centres, initially created as virtual centres, would gradually get converted as full-fledged physical centres in about two years' time and are envisioned to become hubs for innovation, research, technology development, skill-development, consulting and outreach, around which not only the LNMIIT but also many other institutions in the vicinity (or even beyond) might get enabled over the years.</p>
